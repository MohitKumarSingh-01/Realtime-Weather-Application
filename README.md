Hi Guys!

I have create a web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Rest API.

Let's talk about the application our weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (Greater Noida).

The API provider is :- http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
