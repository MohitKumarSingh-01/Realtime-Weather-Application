Hi Guys!

Today i'm going to create a new web application with HTML,CSS,JavaScript.

The only difficulty you might face, is how to work with an API using JavaScript.

Let's talk about the application you're going to build. our weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (Greater Noida).

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
